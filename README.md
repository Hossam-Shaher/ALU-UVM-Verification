# ALU: UVM Verification
This N-bit ALU takes two N-bit operands and performs an operation (ADD, SUB, AND, or OR) then outputs the result. 
Also, for output flags are provided (zero_f, neg_f, c_out_f, and overflow_f).

In this project, the ALU is designed, modeled, and verified using the SystemVerilog HDVL and the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM).
